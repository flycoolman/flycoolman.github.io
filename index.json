This makes me have the idea to create one and help others to understand the whole process. In this tutorial, we will use the tools GitHub Pages, Hugo and Academic.\nThis is the Part-1 of this series.\nPrerequisites Before contiduing this tutorial, you should have the basic knowledge of the following items:\n Git GitHub HTTP HTTPS DNS   If you are familiar with these and just want to build your website quickly, you can jump to Part-3.   Tools GitHub Pages  GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service that takes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files straight from a repository on GitHub, optionally runs the files through a build process, and publishes a website.\nHugo  Hugo is a fast and modern static site generator written in Go.\nAcademic  Academic is a website builder for Hugo. Build anything with widgets and personalize your site with themes, plugins, and language packs.\nHow to Use the Tools From the brief introduction above, you have known what the tools are. Basically we will use Hugo to generate the website, personalize it with Academic, and deploy it to GitHub Pages. Now let\u0026rsquo;s put hands on it. We will start from \u0026lsquo;Hello World\u0026rsquo;.\nHello World of GitHub Pages Please follow the GitHub Pages Hello World Guide.\nHello World of Hugo Hugo official site has a quick start on macOS. But it may not install the latest version of Hugo, like on Ubuntu 18.04, the Hugo version is quite old if installing by apt. I will introduce the steps on Ubuntu 18.04 here.\nStep 1 - Install mkdir -p temp cd temp/ wget https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/download/v0.73.0/hugo_0.73.0_Linux-64bit.deb sudo dpkg -i hugo_0.73.0_Linux-64bit.deb hugo version  The output like below\n Hugo Static Site Generator v0.73.0-428907CC linux/amd64 BuildDate: 2020-06-23T16:30:43Z\n Step 2 - New Site sudo rm hugo_0.73.0_Linux-64bit.deb mkdir hugo-sites cd hugo-sites/ hugo new site hello-world  The output like below\n Congratulations! Your new Hugo site is created in /home/hongwei/temp/hugo-sites/hello-world.\nJust a few more steps and you\u0026rsquo;re ready to go:\n Download a theme into the same-named folder. Choose a theme from https://themes.gohugo.io/ or create your own with the \u0026ldquo;hugo new theme \u0026rdquo; command. Perhaps you want to add some content. You can add single files with \u0026ldquo;hugo new /.\u0026rdquo;. Start the built-in live server via \u0026ldquo;hugo server\u0026rdquo;.  Visit https://gohugo.io/ for quickstart guide and full documentation.\n Let\u0026rsquo;s see the structure of the directory\ncd hello-world tree  The output like below\nLet\u0026rsquo;s check the result\nhugo server  Now go to http://127.0.0.1:1313, you get a blank page.\nStep 3 - Hello World To ask the website to say \u0026lsquo;Hello World\u0026rsquo;, we need to add content and template.\nAdd a file named _index.md in the fold of content\ncd content/ vi _index.md  The file content\n ---\ntitle: Hello, World!\ndescription: |\nMy personal site.\n---\nWelcome to my personal site.\n Add a html template file named index.html in the fold of layouts\ncd .. cd layouts/ vi index.html cd ..  To check the result\nhugo server  Now you get the \u0026lsquo;Hello World\u0026rsquo; page.\nTo customize the website, we will discuss Hugo theme and Academic in Part-2.\nDid you find this page helpful?
