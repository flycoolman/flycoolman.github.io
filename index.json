As this was a very short term project, I would like to set up the environment in a VM. Instead of downloading Linux image, install it on VirtualBox or KVM, Vagrant is handy to use, particularly for development environment. I was thinking to get some new exeperience. Then CentOS 8 came up, as I have been using CentOS 7, but no CentOS 8 experience. And also I wanted the environment with GUI, so that I dould test my code on the VM directly.\nWhy to upgrade VirtualBox and Vagrant I had VirtualBox and Vagrant on my machine(Ubuntu 18.04). So it was straight forward to boot up CentOS 8 by changing the Vagrantfile.\n # -*- mode: ruby -*-\n# vi: set ft=ruby :\nVagrant.configure(\u0026ldquo;2\u0026rdquo;) do |config|\nconfig.vm.box = \u0026ldquo;centos/8\u0026rdquo;\nconfig.vm.box_check_update = false\nconfig.vm.hostname = \u0026ldquo;centos8\u0026rdquo;\nconfig.vm.provider \u0026ldquo;virtualbox\u0026rdquo; do |vb|\n# Display the VirtualBox GUI when booting the machine\nvb.gui = true\nvb.memory = \u0026ldquo;4096\u0026rdquo;\nvb.cpus = 4\nend\nend\n  Vagrantfile   After\n Vagrant up\n I could vagrant ssh to the VM and there was terminal on VirtualBox console. Everything worked well until the GUI was installed and started. I could not get into the GUI of CentOS.\nI guessed to upgrade the VirtualBox might resolve the issue, because I had VirtualBox 5.2. The latest version of VirtualBox is 6.1. So I started upgrading VirutalBox.\nUpgrade VirtualBox 6.1 To install the latest version of VirtualBox, the usual way is to download the .DEB binary package simply from VirtualBox downloads page\nwget https://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/6.1.12/virtualbox-6.1_6.1.12-139181~Ubuntu~bionic_amd64.deb  Install the package by dpkg\ndpkg -i virtualbox-6.1_6.1.12-139181~Ubuntu~bionic_amd64.deb sudo apt install -f  or apt\nsudo apt install ./virtualbox-6.1_6.1.12-139181~Ubuntu~bionic_amd64.deb  Upgrade Vagrant 2.9.9 To support VirtualBox 6.1, I also have to upgrade Vagrant to 2.9.9. Again download the DEB package from Vagrant release website and install with dpkg or apt.\ncurl -O https://releases.hashicorp.com/vagrant/2.2.9/vagrant_2.2.9_x86_64.deb sudo apt install ./vagrant_2.2.9_x86_64.deb  To verify that the installation was successful, run the following command which prints the Vagrant version:\nvagrant --version  Install Virtualbox-dkms When VirtualBox is upgraded, the old virtual machines might fail to open. Some error information like below:\n Failed to open a session for the virtual machine xxxxxxx.\nThe VM session was closed before any attempt to power it on.\nResult Code: NS_ERROR_FAILURE (0x80004005)\nComponent: SessionMachine\nInterface: ISession {7844aa05-b02e-4cdd-a04f-ade4a762e6b7}\n Even running the command \u0026lsquo;sudo /sbin/vboxconfig\u0026rsquo; can\u0026rsquo;t resolve the issue. the dkms package needs to be reinstalled.\ndpkg -l | grep virtualbox-dkms sudo apt-get purge virtualbox-dkms \u0026amp;\u0026amp; sudo apt-get install dkms sudo /sbin/vboxconfig  Install VirtualBox Extension Pack After the Vagrant and VirtualBox had been upgraded, unfortunately I still couldn\u0026rsquo;t make the CentOS 8 GUI working, even though I tried all the options of \u0026lsquo;Graphics Controller\u0026rsquo;. When I tried to connect the VM by RDP, I got an error message of no VirtualBox Extension Pack. Here is the step to install the VirtualBox Extension Pack.\nStep 1 Go to the virtualbox official website and download the package.\nStep 2 Double click the file, such as\n Oracle_VM_VirtualBox_Extension_Pack-6.1.12\n then follow the wizard to install.\nUnfortunately the RDP did not show me the desktop successfully either.\nInstall Vagrant Plugin vagrant-libvirt As I couldn\u0026rsquo;t make the CentOS 8 GUI working on VirtualBox with Vagrant, then I moved to Libvirt with Vagrant. But When I did \u0026lsquo;vagrant up\u0026rsquo;, got the below error.\nIt seemed that the libvirt plugin was not installed, because I installed Vagrant by DEB package, not apt. To install Vagrant Plugin vagrant-libvert, please follow the Vagrant Libvirt Provider on GitHub.\nStep 1 The packages for building needs to be installed.\napt-get build-dep vagrant ruby-libvirt apt-get install qemu libvirt-bin ebtables dnsmasq-base apt-get install libxslt-dev libxml2-dev libvirt-dev zlib1g-dev ruby-dev  Step 2 Install the plugin. vagrant plugin install vagrant-libvirt\nNon-exist Box Error I even tried some pre-built box with GUI, but the box was gone when I used the new version Vagrant.\nTerminal Mode  Bad news - I have not made the CentOS 8 GUI working on VM through Vagrant with either VirtualBox or Libvirt.   The pictures below show the successful terminal.\n The username and password for console are vagrant and vagrant.

This makes me have the idea to create one and help others to understand the whole process. In this tutorial, we will use the tools GitHub Pages, Hugo and Academic.\nThis is the Part-1 of this series.\nPrerequisites Before contiduing this tutorial, you should have the basic knowledge of the following items:\n Git GitHub HTTP HTTPS DNS   If you are familiar with these and just want to build your website quickly, you can jump to Part-3.   Tools GitHub Pages  GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service that takes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files straight from a repository on GitHub, optionally runs the files through a build process, and publishes a website.\nHugo  Hugo is a fast and modern static site generator written in Go.\nAcademic  Academic is a website builder for Hugo. Build anything with widgets and personalize your site with themes, plugins, and language packs.\nHow to Use the Tools From the brief introduction above, you have known what the tools are. Basically we will use Hugo to generate the website, personalize it with Academic, and deploy it to GitHub Pages. Now let\u0026rsquo;s put hands on it. We will start from \u0026lsquo;Hello World\u0026rsquo;.\nHello World of GitHub Pages Please follow the GitHub Pages Hello World Guide.\nHello World of Hugo Hugo official site has a quick start on macOS. But it may not install the latest version of Hugo, like on Ubuntu 18.04, the Hugo version is quite old if installing by apt. I will introduce the steps on Ubuntu 18.04 here.\nStep 1 - Install mkdir -p temp cd temp/ wget https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/download/v0.73.0/hugo_0.73.0_Linux-64bit.deb sudo dpkg -i hugo_0.73.0_Linux-64bit.deb hugo version  The output like below\n Hugo Static Site Generator v0.73.0-428907CC linux/amd64 BuildDate: 2020-06-23T16:30:43Z\n Step 2 - New Site sudo rm hugo_0.73.0_Linux-64bit.deb mkdir hugo-sites cd hugo-sites/ hugo new site hello-world  The output like below\n Congratulations! Your new Hugo site is created in /home/hongwei/temp/hugo-sites/hello-world.\nJust a few more steps and you\u0026rsquo;re ready to go:\n Download a theme into the same-named folder. Choose a theme from https://themes.gohugo.io/ or create your own with the \u0026ldquo;hugo new theme \u0026rdquo; command. Perhaps you want to add some content. You can add single files with \u0026ldquo;hugo new /.\u0026rdquo;. Start the built-in live server via \u0026ldquo;hugo server\u0026rdquo;.  Visit https://gohugo.io/ for quickstart guide and full documentation.\n Let\u0026rsquo;s see the structure of the directory\ncd hello-world tree  The output like below\nLet\u0026rsquo;s check the result\nhugo server  Now go to http://127.0.0.1:1313, you get a blank page.\nStep 3 - Hello World To ask the website to say \u0026lsquo;Hello World\u0026rsquo;, we need to add content and template.\nAdd a file named _index.md in the fold of content\ncd content/ vi _index.md  The file content\n ---\ntitle: Hello, World!\ndescription: |\nMy personal site.\n---\nWelcome to my personal site.\n Add a html template file named index.html in the fold of layouts\ncd .. cd layouts/ vi index.html cd ..  To check the result\nhugo server  Now you get the \u0026lsquo;Hello World\u0026rsquo; page.\nTo customize the website, we will discuss Hugo theme and Academic in Part-2.\nDid you find this page helpful?
